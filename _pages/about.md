I'm a graduate researcher working at the University of Oxford. My research focus is primarily the dynamics of compact objects within the centers of galaxies, where the presence of a gaseous disc around a central supermassive black hole provides an intriguing environment for gravitational wave sources. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have the potential to produce merging stellar-mass black hole binaries by capturing single black holes into their disc, forming them into binaries and then hardening them to merger. 

I conduct this research from a primarily computational viewpoint, investigating the complex interplay between n-body dynamics and gas hydrodynamics using the simulation code [Athena++](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena).

This website hosts a list of my published papers, talks and talks. If you have any questions about the work I do, please get in touch.

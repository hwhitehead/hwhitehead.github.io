I'm a graduate researcher working at the University of Oxford. My research focus is primarily the dynamics of compact objects within the centers of galaxies, where the presence of gaseous discs around supermassive black holes can provide an intriguing environment for gravitational wave sources. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have the potential to produce merging stellar-mass black hole binaries by capturing single black holes into their disc, forming them into binaries and then hardening them to merger. Understanding the efficiency of binary black hole formation is crucial in determining the importance of the AGN channel for gravitational wave events.

I conduct this research from a primarily computational viewpoint, investigating the complex interplay between n-body dynamics and gas hydrodynamics using the simulation code [Athena++](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena).

This website hosts a list of my published papers, talks and some visualtions. If you have any questions about the work I do, please get in touch.

Hobby Project: \
Predicting exoplanet colours using synethetic spectra generated using known planetary properties. Planet colours were generated for the full NASA catalogue and then a custom-built raytracing code rendered images of the star system. A lightweight Python GUI was built to allow for easy system selection.

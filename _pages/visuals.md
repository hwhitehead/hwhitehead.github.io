## Chronology of Binary Formation
Energetic evolution of a flyby between two black holes, simulated with a 3D adiabatic mixture of gas and radiation. During each close encounter, the binary loses energy to the gas and shrinks.

## 3D Temperature Contours for Adiabatic Binary Formation
Isotemperature contours for an interaction between two black holes, for a 3D adiabatic mixture of gas and radiation. Close encounters harden the binary and result in strong injections of thermal energy to the circum-binary region. Parent paper currently in final prep.

## Radiative Binary Formation
Logarithmic thermal emission maps for an interaction between two black holes, for a 2D adiabatic mixture of gas and radiation. Each close encounter prompts a burst of thermal emission due to strong heating from the minidisc collisions. See [here](/publication/Whitehead2024b) for the parent paper.

## Isothermal Binary Formation
Logarithmic density maps for an interaction between two black holes, for a 2D isothermal gas. The binary steadily loses energy due to the gas gravity, resulting in a shrinking binary. See [here](/publication/Whitehead2024b) for the parent paper.

## EXOTIC: Exoplanet Observables Translated Into Colour
A hobby project involving predicting exoplanet colours using synethetic spectra generated from known planetary properties. Planet colours were generated for the full NASA catalogue and then a custom-built Cpp raytracing code rendered images of each star system. A Perlin noise map is imposed on each planetary surface to make for a more realistic texture.

A lightweight Python Tkinter GUI was also built to allow for easy system selection.

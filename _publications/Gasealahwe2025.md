Abstract:\
ABSTRACT
The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts
every 16.5 d, likely due to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio image of the field, which
reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are aligned with the mean axis of the smaller scale jets observed close to the X-ray
binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble, which is around $$E_\mathrm{min} = 10^{45}$$ erg. The nature and
morphological structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and numerical simulations. The spectral
index map reveals a large fraction of the nebulaâ€™s radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin synchrotron
emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra. Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral
index of the protruding bubbles. We used the $$\texttt{PLUTO}$$ code to run relativistic hydrodynamic simulations to try and qualitatively
reproduce the observations with a combined supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in which
the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion which is closely followed (within 100 yr) by a phase of
very powerful jets lasting less than 1000 yr. These are the first observations revealing the initial breakout of neutron star jets
from their natal supernova remnant, and further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the archetypal jet
source SS433.
